## üìö More tutorial information

Go Travel is an application for visualizing travel destinations, developed from the tutorial [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/@BrianDesign).
The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis implementation tutorial is to learn and develop the concepts of the Gatsby framework, a reasonable alternative compared to one of the favorites on the current market, NextJS. The fact that it works with static websites optimizes file loading results, improving metrics with Google and improving the user experience. In terms of styling, it is very versatile and can be adapted with tailwindCSS, emotion, styled-components , SASS. It was my first contact with GraphQL, which I had already heard about before, and it seems to be a differentiator in the market.
